    Windows Server 2022: This is a recycled HP Office computer, which I put x2 SSD's in, and x2 HDD's in. One of the HDD's is running as a mirrored backup drive. 
    This server used to be using the Linux based OS, TrueNAS, however it kept having issues with the BOOT partition and I switched over to Windows Server.

    This website has been a project in and of its self, as I have had to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript! I hosted it on GitPages as to protect my IP, and to not expose my
    my server to the public Internet.
