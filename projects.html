    Windows Server 2022: This is a recycled HP Office computer, which I put x2 SSD's in, and x2 HDD's in. One of the HDD's is running as a mirrored backup drive. 
    This server used to be using the Linux based OS, TrueNAS, however it kept having issues with the BOOT partition and I switched over to Windows Server.

    This was my first time working with Powershell to such a degree, and I had to self-teach myself a lot!
